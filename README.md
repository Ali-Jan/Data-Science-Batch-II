## 1. Term Deposit Subscription Prediction (Bank Marketing)

**Objective:**   
Predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit as a result of a marketing campaign.   

**Dataset:**   
Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)

**Approach:**   
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Encoded all categorical features properly
- Trained classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluated the models using Confusion Matrix, F1-Score, and ROC Curve
- Used SHAP to explain the model predictions

**Skills Gained:**   
- Classification modeling
- Feature encoding
- Model interpretability (Explainable AI - XAI)
- Customer behavior analysis

## 2. Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning
**Objective:**   
Cluster customers based on spending habits and propose marketing strategies tailored to each segment.   

**Dataset:**   
Mall Customers Dataset

**Approach:**
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Applied K-Means Clustering to segment customers
- Used PCA to visualize the clusters
- Suggested relevant marketing strategies for each identified segment

**Skills Gained:**   
- Unsupervised learning (K-Means)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Customer segmentation
- Strategy development based on data insights

## 3. Energy Consumption Time Series Forecasting
**Objective:**
Forecast short-term household energy usage using historical time-based patterns.

**Dataset:**
Household Power Consumption Dataset

**Approach:**   
- Parsed and resampled the time series data
- Engineered time-based features (e.g., hour of day, weekday/weekend)
- Compared performance of ARIMA, Prophet, and XGBoost models
- Plotted actual vs. forecasted energy usage for visualization

**Skills Gained:**   
- Time series forecasting
- Feature engineering
- Model comparison and evaluation (MAE, RMSE)
- Temporal data visualization

## Loan Default Risk with Business Cost Optimization
**Objective:**   
Predict the likelihood of a loan default and optimize the decision threshold based on cost-benefit analysis.

**Dataset:**   
Home Credit Default Risk Dataset

**Approach:**   
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset
- Trained binary classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, CatBoost)
- Defined business cost values for false positives and false negatives
- Adjusted the model threshold to minimize total business cost

**Skills Gained:**   
- Binary classification modeling
- Cost-based evaluation metrics
- Risk modeling and scoring
- Feature importance analysis

## 5. Interactive Business Dashboard in Streamlit
**Objective:**   
Develop an interactive dashboard for analyzing sales, profit, and segment-wise performance.

**Dataset:**
Global Superstore Dataset

**Approach:**
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset
- Built a Streamlit dashboard with filters (Region, Category, Sub-Category)
- Displayed key performance indicators (KPIs) using charts:
  - Total Sales
  - Profit
  - Top 5 Customers by Sales

**Skills Gained:**
- Business Intelligence (BI) dashboarding
- Data storytelling
- User interactivity with Streamlit
- Visual KPI analysis
